Roadmap for MU support:
Trustroot should have a * if constant( "VHOST" ) !== 'no'


Returns from begin() need better error handling.
Username should be normalized to http-domain-com-path-component-query-component

Incompatible with Clutter Free. (Global vars?)
Incompatible with K2's comments. (Comment type?)
